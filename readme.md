# TokenVoting

A token voting web application allowing the purchasing of shares/tokens in order to vote for candidates per share/token (adaptible to a shareholder contract). Designed and tested using Truffle on my private PoA & PoW testnet.

TokenVoting smart contract registered and verified at https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x054d7534fdcfdc2117972ad94262043d4bc31ce0.
